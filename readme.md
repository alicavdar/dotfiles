# My dotfiles

## Steps

1. **Install Developer Tools**
   - This might take some time, so start this first.
2. **Install 1Password**
3. **Sign in to GitHub**
   - Set up a new SSH key.
4. **Install Homebrew**
   - Run `brew bundle install`. This will take some time, so do something else while it runs.
   - Ensure that `HOMEBREW_PREFIX` is set correctly.
5. **Run `bootstrap.sh`**
6. **Run `macos.sh`**
   - Remember to modify Caps Lock to Control.

## Independent Tasks

These tasks can be done at any time as they don't depend on the main setup steps:

1. **Install Firefox**
   - Set it as your default browser.
2. **Install Chrome**
3. **Download profile photo for avatars**
  ```bash
  wget https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/779832 -O ~/Desktop/profile-photo.png
  ```
